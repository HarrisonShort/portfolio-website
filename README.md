This repo contains the full source code of my portfolio website, [harrisonshort.com](harrisonshort.com). 

## Current State

Currently, my portfolio website is in an MVP state. 
It contains enough information to replace my previous website (hosted on Squarespace), while also serving as a measuring point of where my web development skills are at.
My hope is that as I continue developing as a web developer, I will continue to expand upon my portfolio website, improving it in the process.

Please note that while I am more experienced with C# (alongside the Unity game engine), I am still quite a novice web developer. If you have any critique, I would be greatful to receive it!
